                <p>Iâ€™ve been a designer for 6 years and loved every minute of it. I have worked for a publishing company creating online homepage assets and email marketing ads. I have worked extensively with site management and image display. Recently, I have been enjoying UX/UI and applying my knowledge with our email and site strategies.

                    I specialize in digital advertisements and user experience design. I prefer to solve problems by looking at the situation from as many angles as possible and considering every outcome. I get excited when inspiration hits and I try something new. But I feel especially proud when the client or co-worker understands my vision and trusts my skills.
                    
                    What sets me apart from others is my passion for design and how I strive to understand my users or clientele when put on a team or project. I always work hard to listen to my client and understand their vision so I can help them bring what they imagine to life. Even when that requires me to reach beyond my skill set. I am always excited to learn something new to add to my tool belt.
